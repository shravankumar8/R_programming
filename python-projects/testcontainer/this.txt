We generate a decryption key and print it. Note that in practice, you should securely save the decryption key because it's required to decrypt the files.

We loop through the files in the current directory.

For all other files, we attempt to decrypt their contents using the provided key. If decryption is successful, we write the decrypted data back to the file.

If decryption fails for any reason, we catch the exception and print an error message, indicating that the de
